With the goal of supporting the exploration and research of techniques dealing with offline learning based on data (e.g. offline Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, etc.), DIAMBRA Arena comes with two, easy-to-use, useful features: an environment wrapper allowing to record episodes (to be used, for example, to save human expert demonstrations), and a loader class allowing to easily access the stored dataset.

### Episode Recording Wrapper

In order to activate the episode recording wrapper, one has just to add an additional kwargs dictionary, conventionally named `episode_recording_settings`, to the environment creation method, as shown in the next code block.

```python
env = diambra.arena.make("doapp", settings, wrappers_settings, episode_recording_settings)
```

The dictionary has to be populated as described in the following table:

| <strong><span style="color:#5B5B60;">Key</span></strong> | <strong><span style="color:#5B5B60;">Type</span></strong> | <strong><span style="color:#5B5B60;">Default Value(s)</span></strong> | <strong><span style="color:#5B5B60;">Description</span></strong>                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `username`                                               | `str`                                                     | `username`                                                                     | Provides an identifier to be associated with the recorded episode                                                                                         |
| `dataset_path`                                              | `str`                                                     | `./`                                                                     | Specifies the path where to save recorded episodes                                                                                                        |

```python
episode_recording_settings["username"] = "user"
episode_recording_settings["dataset_path"] = "/home/user/DIAMBRA/"
```

{{% notice note %}}
By default, this wrapper acts _before_ wrappers are applied. Thus, it will store the original, native, unprocessed observations (and reward and actions) as generated by the base environment. This guarantees a better generality and transferability of the generated dataset, but requires preprocessing at load time.

### Dataset Loader

DIAMBRA Arena provides a simple dedicated class `DiambraDataLoader` demonstrating how to load and minimally process recorded episodes, it only requires the dataset folder path as input parameter and can be customized adding the additional processing operations required. The data loader class is created as follows:

```python
from diambra.arena.utils.diambra_data_loader import DiambraDataLoader
data_loader = DiambraDataLoader(dataset_path)
```
