This section aims at providing guidance to every coder, assisting him in the learning journey that will lead to the creation of a trained AI agent capable of effectively playing DIAMBRA Arena Environments.

There are two main steps as the Index shows: the first one, [Learning RL](/deeprltraining/learningrl), is focused on getting started with RL, presenting resources that cover from the basics up to the most advanced details of the latest, best-performing algorithms. 

The second one, [End-to-end DeepRL Training](./endtoendtraining), provides a step-by-step guide showing how to successfully train a Deep RL agent in our Environments.
