This section provide guidance to every coder, even to (or especially to) those who are not familiar with Reinforcement Learning, in the learning journey that will lead to the creation of a trained agent capable of effectively playing DIAMBRA Arena Environments.

There are two main steps as the Index shows: the first one, ["Learning RL"](/deeprltraining/learningrl), is focused on getting started with RL, presenting resources that cover from the basics up to the most advanced details of the latest, best-performing algorithms. 

The second one, [End-to-end DeepRL Training](./endtoendtraining), provides a step-by-step guide showing how to successfully train a Deep RL agent in DIAMBRA Arena Environments.
